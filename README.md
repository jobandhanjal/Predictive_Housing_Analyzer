# 🏠 Predictive Housing Price Analyzer  
*A from-scratch implementation of Linear Regression with Gradient Descent*

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements a **Linear Regression model from scratch** in Python using only **NumPy**, without relying on machine learning libraries.  
The goal is to predict **housing prices** based on various features, while demonstrating:  

- Core ML theory (Hypothesis, Cost Function, Gradient Descent).  
- Object-Oriented Design (`MyLinearRegression` class).  
- Data Preprocessing (scaling, train/test split from scratch).  
- Visualization of learning dynamics and results.  
- Benchmarking against **scikit-learn’s LinearRegression**.
